    "## 🐍 Understanding Objects in Python — The Foundation You Shouldn’t Skip!\n",
    "\n",
    "When learning Python, most people get introduced to the concept of **objects** only after reaching **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.\n",
    "However, that’s a missed opportunity!\n",
    "\n",
    "You should understand **objects** right after your initial introduction to Python — once you’ve written a few lines of code. Doing so helps you **grasp the real building blocks** of your programs and makes future concepts like functions and classes much easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Why Care About Objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of **objects** as the *main characters* in a story — they drive everything forward!\n",
    "In programming, objects help you **organize and manage data** easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, imagine you’re dealing with numbers, text, or lists. Objects allow you to **group related data together** and **interact** with them using *methods* (like calling a friend for help).\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything in Python — numbers, strings, lists, even functions — is an **object**!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 Understanding Objects with a Simple Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a simple Python program and **break it down** into its key components.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "m = 10\n",
    "n = 20\n",
    "p = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "greeting = \"Good morning!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding a dictionary\n",
    "person = {\n",
    "    \"name\": \"Alice\",\n",
    "    \"age\": 30,\n",
    "    \"hobbies\": [\"reading\", \"cycling\", \"hiking\"]\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "def complex_function(y, factor=2):\n",
    "    # This function will cube the number and then multiply by the factor.\n",
    "    result = y ** 3 * factor\n",
    "    if y % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        result += y\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        result -= y\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "print(complex_function(2))   # output = 18 (2^3 * 2 + 2)\n",
    "print(complex_function(3, 3))  # output = 78 (3^3 * 3 - 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Printing dictionary values\n",
    "print(f\"Name: {person['name']}, Age: {person['age']}, \"\n",
    "      f\"Hobbies: {', '.join(person['hobbies'])}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will help you see how every piece of code fits into Python’s object-oriented world.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔷 Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "To a beginner, think of **objects** as *instances of data* that occupy space in memory.\n",
    "Every object has a **type**, which defines what kind of object it is and what it can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example given above:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `10` → an **integer object** (`int`)\n",
    "* `20` → another **integer object**\n",
    "* `[1, 2, 3]` → a **list object** containing three integer objects — a *compound object* made up of simpler ones\n",
    "* `\"Good morning!\"` → a **string object**\n",
    "* `{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"hobbies\": [\"reading\", \"cycling\", \"hiking\"]}` → a **dictionary object** containing multiple data types (strings, integers, lists)\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside this dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\"Alice\"`, `30`, `[\"reading\", \"cycling\", \"hiking\"]` → are **string**, **integer**, and **list** objects respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the **function** you define is an object:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `complex_function` → a **function object**\n",
    "* `2` and `3` → **integer objects** used as arguments\n",
    "* `18` and `78` → **integer objects** returned as results\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🏷️ Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identifiers** are names you assign to various program elements like variables and functions.\n",
    "They help you *refer* to the objects you create.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `m` → identifier for integer object `10`\n",
    "* `n` → identifier for integer object `20`\n",
    "* `p` → identifier for list object `[1, 2, 3]`\n",
    "* `greeting` → identifier for string `\"Good morning!\"`\n",
    "* `person` → identifier for the dictionary object\n",
    "* `name`, `age`, `hobbies` → keys inside the dictionary\n",
    "* `complex_function` → identifier for the function\n",
    "* `y`, `factor`, `result` → identifiers inside the function (parameters and variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ➕ Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operators** perform actions or operations on your objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operator | Purpose        |\n",
    "| -------- | -------------- |\n",
    "| `**`     | Exponentiation |\n",
    "| `*`      | Multiplication |\n",
    "| `+`      | Addition       |\n",
    "| `-`      | Subtraction    |\n",
    "| `%`      | Modulus        |\n",
    "| `=`      | Assignment     |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔠 Delimiters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Delimiters** are symbols that separate or structure different parts of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Delimiter | Use                                                       |\n",
    "| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| `,`       | Separates list elements or function arguments             |\n",
    "| `=`       | Assigns values to variables                               |\n",
    "| `[]`      | Defines lists or accesses dictionary values               |\n",
    "| `{}`      | Defines dictionaries                                      |\n",
    "| `()`      | Defines function parameters or calls                      |\n",
    "| `:`       | Ends function headers, defines dictionary key-value pairs |\n",
    "| `\"`       | Denotes string literals                                   |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔑 Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keywords** are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and can’t be used as identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Keyword      | Purpose                         |\n",
    "| ------------ | ------------------------------- |\n",
    "| `def`        | Defines a function              |\n",
    "| `return`     | Returns a value from a function |\n",
    "| `if`, `else` | Used for conditional logic      |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are at the heart of every Python program.\n",
    "They:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Save memory** by creating reusable instances instead of duplicating data.\n",
    "* **Work with identifiers**, which act as names for accessing them.\n",
    "* **Respond to operators** that perform actions on them.\n",
    "* **Rely on delimiters and keywords** to give structure and meaning to your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the next time you read your Python code, try to *see* it through the lens of objects —\n",
    "you’ll realize your code isn’t just a bunch of lines, but a well-orchestrated network of objects working together.\n",

    "## 🔹 Mutable vs Immutable Data Types in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, as seen above, everything is an **object** — but ***not all objects behave the same when you try to change them.***\n",
    "Objects are broadly divided into two categories: **mutable** and **immutable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 What Are Mutable Objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mutable objects** are those that **can be changed** after creation.\n",
    "You can modify their content — add, remove, or update elements — without creating a new object in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `list`\n",
    "* `dict`\n",
    "* `set`\n",
    "* `bytearray`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example in code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "numbers.append(4)\n",
    "print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the list `numbers` was modified directly — its memory address remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 What Are Immutable Objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Immutable objects** **cannot be changed** once created.\n",
    "If you try to modify them, Python actually creates a **new object** with a different memory address.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `int`\n",
    "* `float`\n",
    "* `str`\n",
    "* `tuple`\n",
    "* `bool`\n",
    "* `frozenset`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example in code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"Binayak\"\n",
    "name += \" Basu\"\n",
    "print(name)  # Output: Binayak Basu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though it looks like we modified `name`, Python created a new string in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature                          | Mutable         | Immutable              |\n",
    "| -------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |\n",
    "| Can be changed after creation    | ✅ Yes           | ❌ No                   |\n",
    "| Memory address changes on update | ❌ No            | ✅ Yes                  |\n",
    "| Examples                         | list, dict, set | str, tuple, int        |\n",
    "| Suitable for                     | Dynamic data    | Fixed or constant data |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 Why Does It Matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this difference helps you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Avoid unexpected bugs (especially when passing lists or dicts to functions)\n",
    "* Write memory-efficient and predictable code\n",
    "* Use the right data type for your task — mutable for dynamic updates, immutable for constant data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mutable:** Can change in place (e.g., lists, dicts).\n",
    "* **Immutable:** New object is created on change (e.g., strings, tuples).\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing when to use each helps make your Python code cleaner, safer, and more efficient.\n",
