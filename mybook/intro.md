# 👋 Welcome to **FromCodeToData**

**FromCodeToData** is your complete, practical guide to mastering **Python** , **NumPy** , and **Pandas** — the foundational trio behind modern data analysis.

This book is designed for learners who want more than surface-level knowledge. You will **build deep intuition** , write efficient code, and confidently work with data through hands-on examples, real datasets, and step-by-step explanations.

Whether you’re just starting out or strengthening your data skills, this book will help you move from writing basic Python code to performing powerful data manipulations.

## 🎯 What This Book Covers

This book focuses on **three core pillars** of data work:

### **1. Python — The Language of Data**

- Master variables, control flow, functions, modules, and object-oriented programming
- Understand data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
- Build strong programming habits that make later data tasks easier and cleaner

### **2. NumPy — Fast Numerical Computing**

- Learn how numerical computation really works under the hood
- Work with **ndarrays** , vectorization, broadcasting, indexing, and performance optimization
- Perform mathematical and statistical operations at scale

### **3. Pandas — The Power of Tabular Data**

- Load, clean, filter, aggregate, reshape, and transform datasets
- Work with DataFrames like a professional data analyst
- Handle missing values, merge datasets, create new features, and prepare data for further analysis

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

This book is **example-driven and practice-focused** .

You will:

- **Read** the concepts
- **Run** the code
- **Experiment** with variations
- **Understand** why things work

Because the best way to learn data analysis is not by memorizing — but by **doing the work yourself** .

## 🏗️ Structure of the Book

Here’s the simple, logical progression you’ll follow:

```
Python → NumPy → Pandas
```

Each section builds on the previous one so that when you reach Pandas, you’ll already have the programming and numerical foundations needed to succeed.

## 📌 By the End of This Book

You will be able to:

- Write clean and efficient Python code
- Perform numerical computing with NumPy like a pro
- Manipulate, clean, and analyze datasets using Pandas
- Build your own data workflows from scratch

---

## 🧭 How to Navigate

- Use the sidebar to progress chapter by chapter
- Run the examples in your Jupyter environment
- Return to earlier sections anytime you want to reinforce your skills
